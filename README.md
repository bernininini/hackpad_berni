# Inspiration
i wanted a macropad that wasn't just useful but also fun to mess with while i’m working or coding. something simple, and satisfying to press. so i built the bean pad — 6 switches (brown), an oled screen, and a xiao microcontroller.

# Challenges
first time messing around with routing properly — and wow, it was annoying. i kept messing up the pin mapping and had to recheck the wiring like few times. also, dealing with the i2c address gave me pain. still, once i figured it out, it felt so rewarding to see text show up on the screen.
