# Inspiration
i wanted a macropad that wasn't just useful but also fun to mess with while i’m working or coding. something simple, and satisfying to press. so i built the bean pad — 6 switches (brown), an oled screen, and a xiao microcontroller.

# Challenges
First time messing around with routing properly. It was annoying but super fun! I kept messing up the pin mapping and had to recheck the wiring like few times.
